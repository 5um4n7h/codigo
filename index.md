## what is c++? It's a object oriented programming language
   created by <i> Bjarne Stroustrup </i> . It's widely used 
   in creating games and operating systems such as windows.
   It's also used in competitive programming due it's several libraries 

### To get started with writing c++ programming , you must first install 
    an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) which is basically a text editor with a

## GETTING STARTED-

Step 1: INSTALL AN IDE

## There are a lot of IDE's to choose from,such as Visual Studio Code , CodeBlocks ,dev c++
